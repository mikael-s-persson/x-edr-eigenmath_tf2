description:
  "tf2 is the second generation of the transform library, which lets the "
  "user keep track of multiple coordinate frames over time. tf2 maintains "
  "the relationship between coordinate frames in a tree structure buffered "
  "in time, and lets the user transform points, vectors, etc between any two "
  "coordinate frames at any desired point in time."

    "Moved the code from third_party/blue/core/blue_tf2 to third_party/blue_tf2"
    " to comply with third_party policy. "
